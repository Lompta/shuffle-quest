# shuffle-quest

## About
Sometimes when I shuffle cards, it is bad. I only take some random small number of cards off of the top and the bottom, then put those cards collectively either on the top or bottom of the deck. Basically I am just cutting the deck over and over, in disguise as something else.

I have taught The Computer to also shuffle this way, in solidarity with me, a poor shuffler.

## Enhancements
Someday... maybe there will be *more* ways to shuffle. Pile shuffling. True random shuffling. No shuffling. The possibilities are unlimited.

## Wow
Yes. Wow.
